# Implementing Priority Queue for CS271

Instructor: Dr. Currin

Group members: Joel Singh and Colin Nguyen

Implementation of Priority Queue using a heap for Denison University CS271's
Data Structures class for Fall 2025.


## File Structure

Our MinQueue is implemented in `./MinQueue.cpp` with a header file at
`./MinQueue.h`. Furthermore, our main testing is at
`./test_minqueue_example.cpp`. Moreover, a utility function, `test`, used
within `./test_minqueue_example.cpp` and declared in `./test.cpp` compares an
actual and expected, printing out success or failure. Our time tests are
located at `./test_minqueue_times.cpp`.
